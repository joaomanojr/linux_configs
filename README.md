# João Mano Jr's Linux configuration project

I am using Linux for a little while. An from time to time preferred applications (and their configs)
come and go.  This project is an organized way to keep these configs under control to ease Linux
updates and maybe help someone else. :)


## Basic info


### System info

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS @ Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4210U CPU @ 1.70GHz, RAM: 8GB



### Requirements

Actually none. Compatible applications' versions installed maybe. :)
One may need python3 if want to render README.md locally.


## Installation

As this still under construction installation is just rsync things in and out. Be sure to check for
install.py scripts onto directories.
